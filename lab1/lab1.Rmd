Lab 1: Introduction to R
========================================================
### Learning objectives:

* setting a working directory (use R Studio `projects`)
* loading R packages (`library()` function)
* loading data (`read_csv()` function)
* data frames and variables
* using a variable from a data frame (the `$` operator)
* plotting a line graph
* renaming a variable

### Background reading
* Chapters [9](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html), [10](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) and the first two sections of chapter [11](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html) in *R for Data Science*

### 1. Setting a working directory

Let's start a new project. We can call it "ba" for business analytics. Click on "Project" icon in the upper right corner of R Studio. Select 'New Project' a 'New directory' choose a folder on your computer where you would like to keep your file for this class.

### 2. Loading packages

Before we can use any packages we have to 'load' them into our R session. We do that by calling  the `library()` function with the name of the package as the only argument. Any package that we want to load needs to be already installed. We need to install a package only once but load it each time we start a new R session.

Let's open a new R Markdown document. R Markdown combines text and R code. R code is enclosed in ![](opening.JPG) and ![](closing.JPG) marks. For example, if we want to load in our `tidyverse` package we type the following:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
To execute the R code (rather than knit the entire R Markdown document), we put the cursor on the line we want to execute and either click run, or hold 'control' key and press 'enter'. 


### 3. Loading data

At last, let's load some data. We will get data from the financial website [quandl](https://www.quandl.com/).  We will use their [free database on daily stock prices of about 3000 U.S. companies](https://www.quandl.com/databases/WIKIP). Each company is stored in a comma delimited file names by the company's ticker. For example, Apple, Inc. ticker is AAPL, so its stock historical stock prices are stored in APPL.csv.

```{r}
mydata <- read_csv("https://www.quandl.com/api/v3/datasets/WIKI/AAPL.csv")
```

Function `read_csv()` reads comma separated files. It takes the location of a file as an argument. The location can be a path on your hard drive or a URL. In this case the location was a URL.  

The `<-` operator assigns the result of the `read_csv()` function to an object we named 'mydata'. The result  of the `read_csv()` function is an object called *tibble* which is a type of *data frame*. You can examine this data frame by clicking on its name in the *Environment* window.

### 3. Data frames and variables

Data frame (or its type *tibble*) is an object that holds variables and observations. Let's examine the structure of our data frame 'mydata'. We can do this by executing `glimpse()` function. (We can do this by either entering the function into the console, or if we want it part of the markdown document, entering it and executing it within the markdown document.)

```{r}
glimpse(mydata)
```

The results tell us that we have over 9 thousand observations and 13 variables. It tells us the variable names, their type and the first few observations. We see that variable Date is a `<date>`, and the rest of the variables are `<dbl>` which means that they are numbers stored with a 'double' precision.

### 4. Using a variable from a data frame

If we want to do something with a particular variable we write the name of the data frame, a '$' sign, and the name of the variable. For example, below we calculate the summary of the variable Close in data frame `mydata`:

```{r}
summary(mydata$Close)
```


### IN-CLASS EXERCISE
1. Load in data on the results of the 2016 NHL season from 
https://dvorakt.github.io/business_analytics/lab1/NHLseason2016.csv 
2. How many games were there?
3. What was the average attendance? 
4. Did home teams score on average more goals than visiting teams?


### 5. Plotting data

Let's plot the closing price of GE. We use a powerful function called `ggplot()`. The function creates a plot by combining a few components. First, it needs to know the data frame from which to get the data. Second, it needs to know which variables should be on the x and y axes. This is specified in `aesthetics()`. Finally, it needs to know the geometric object (geom) we want to use to represent the data (in this case a line). 

```{r fig.height=5}
ggplot(data=mydata, aes(x=Date, y=Close)) + geom_line() 
```

### 6. Renaming variables

Some of the variable in our data frame have inconvenient names (e.g. `Adj. Close` has spaces in its name necessitating the use of quotes). We can rename the variable using the function `rename()` which takes as its first argument a data frame, and as remaining arguments new variable names set equal to old variable names. The function returns a data frame. Below we overwrite our `mydata` data frame with a new one that includes renamed variable. 

```{r}
mydata <- rename(mydata, appl=`Adj. Close`)
```

### IN-CLASS EXERCISE
1. Plot the adjusted closing price of Apple
2. How is it different from the unadjusted price?

## Exercises
Create a new R Markdown file that does the analysis and answers the questions below. Knit your R Markdown into an html, print it and bring to class. Don't forget to load `tidyverse` at the beginning of your code.

1. Download data from quandl on closing stock price of GE. (hint: GE's ticker is GE)  
2. How many observations are available for GE?  
3. Rename Adj. Close as `ge`. 
4. Plot the adjusted closing prices GE over time. Use [this documentation for ggplot2](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Titles_(ggplot2)/) to add title to your plot.   
5. Use [the same documentation](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Axes_(ggplot2)/#continuous-axis) to create a new plot that uses logarithmic scale on the y axis. Add pretty labels on the y axis ('breaks' in `ggplot` terminology). E.g. 100,200,400 etc.  
6. Explain why we see different patterns on the linear versus logarithmic scale plots. (Hint 1: Noting that one is on a logarithmic scale and one is on a linear scale is not a sufficient answer. Hint 2: Think about what the vertical distances between points represent on each of the graphs.)  
7. What are your overall conclusions from these two plots? In other words, what are the key things you feel can be learned about the behavior of the GE over this time frame?
