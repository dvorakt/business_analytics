Project Assignment I: Interesting Data Sources
================================================

It is time to start thinking about your final project. As I said at the beginning of the course, the purpose of the  project is to give you a chance to work on a problem of your own choosing.

In this assignment I would like you to explore data sources that you may use for your project. You should turn in a one-page description of one to three sources that you explored and found interesting. For each source describe the data that is available and what sorts of questions could be answered with that data. Note that this project may be done individually, or in teams of 2 or 3. This assignment is not graded. The purpose is to provide early feedback on your ideas for the project. 

Business data is valuable, and therefore, often private. You will need to be creative in using publicly available sources. The data does not have to be generated by a business to be relevant to business. For example, the Department of Transportation data on airlines, or SEC data on company filings can provide highly relevant insights. 

Below is a list of links with possible data sources. This list is only to get you started. Keep in mind that most interesting analyses come from creative combinations. Don't plan on downloading just one file - your data will most likely be a combination of several data sets that you will slice and dice and reshape.

1. Data science competition platform [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) has a number of very interesting data sets some of which are relevant to business. You can browse the [competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) or [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

5. [Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/) has lots of interesting data sets including these on [medicare charges by providers](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/index.html), or [who prescribes which drugs](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/PartD2014.html), or [drug pricing](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Part-B-Drugs/McrPartBDrugAvgSalesPrice/2016ASPFiles.html)
